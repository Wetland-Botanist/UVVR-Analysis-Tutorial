# UVVR-Analysis-Tutorial

The purpose of this manual is to provide a detailed guide on how to calculate the UVVR for a salt marsh complex in ArcGIS Pro based on the work of Ganju et al. 2017 and Wasson et al. 2021. Their methodologies are great initial resources for those with experience in remote sensing, however, there are numerous detailed steps to fill in, especially for those familiar with ArcGIS Pro but not public aerial imagery or raster classification. The guide is written for those with basic user knowledge of ArcGIS, geospatial data sets and organization, and raster properties. Additionally, we have created a practice data set of Sapowet Marsh (Tiverton, RI) in 2016 for users to gain experience. We hope this guide will aid students, researchers, and coastal managers with their monitoring and restoration goals. 


A folder, file geodatabase, and toolbox were created to compliment and strengthen the tutorial for any user by providing examples of each step. The shapefiles and rasters have brief accompanying metadata describing. All shapefiles, tables, and rasters created in the tutorial are provided except for the NAIP aerial imagery on account of the file size. Rasters and classification schema are located in the folder, shapefiles and tables in the file geodatabase, and tool in the toolbox.
