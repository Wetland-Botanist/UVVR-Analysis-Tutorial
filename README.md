# UVVR Analysis Walkthrough in ArcGIS Pro

Coastal Habitat Restoration Team (CHaRT), University of New Hampshire

The purpose of this manual is to provide a detailed guide on how to calculate the unvegetated - vegetated ratio (UVVR) for a salt marsh complex in ArcGIS Pro based on the work of Ganju et al. 2017 and Wasson et al. 2021. Their methodologies are great initial resources for those with experience in remote sensing, however, there are numerous detailed steps to fill in, especially for those familiar with ArcGIS Pro but not public aerial imagery or raster classification. The guide is written for those with basic user knowledge of ArcGIS, geospatial data sets and organization, and raster properties. Additionally, we have created a practice data set of Sapowet Marsh (Tiverton, RI) in 2016 for users to gain experience. We hope this guide will aid students, researchers, and coastal managers with their monitoring and restoration goals. 


The needed materials for the analysis manual - rasters, shapefiles, and tools - are provided in the Tutorial folder of the repository.
